You can customize the theme by modifying the `theme.js` file located in the `src` directory. This file contains all the necessary configuration for colors, typography, and other UI elements.

### Tables

The tables are built using the `react-table` library, allowing for extensive customization. You can define your columns and data in the `Tables` component located in `src/components/Tables`.

### Charts

Charts are implemented using the `recharts` library. You can find the chart components in the `Charts` directory under `src/components`. Customize the chart data and types as needed.

### Calendar

The calendar feature is powered by the `react-big-calendar` library. It supports various views like month, week, and day. Customize it in the `Calendar` component.

### Kanban Board

The Kanban board is built with the `react-beautiful-dnd` library. You can find and modify it in the `Kanban` component.
